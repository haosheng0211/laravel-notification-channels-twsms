## Installation

```bash
composer require laravel-notification-channels/twsms
```

Add the configuration to your `services.php` config file:

```php
'twsms' => [
    'username' => env('TWSMS_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('TWSMS_PASSWORD'),
]
```

### Setting up the TwSMS service

You'll need an TwSMS account. Head over to their [website](https://example.com/) and create or log in to your account.

Generate API credentials by navigating to the API section in your account settings.

## Usage

You can use the channel in your `via()` method inside the notification:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use NotificationChannels\TwSMS\TwSMSMessage;

class AccountApproved extends Notification
{
    public function via($notifiable)
    {
        return ['twsms'];
    }

    public function toTwSMS($notifiable)
    {
        return (new TwSMSMessage)->content("Task #{$notifiable->id} is complete!");
    }
}
```

In your notifiable model, make sure to include a `routeNotificationForTwSMS()` method, which returns a phone number in the appropriate format.

```php
public function routeNotificationForTwSMS()
{
    return $this->phone; // Example: +1234567890 , need to include country code
}
```

### Available methods

`content()`: Set the content of the notification message.
